# Ames-Housing-data-Visualization
When someone wants to buy their dream house they might be considering many aspects. This includes various features such as house cost, locality, size of the house and many more. Also, the importance of features might vary from person to person. We need to consider all possible features related to the house during this analysis. Most of the variables are exactly the type of information that a typical home buyer would want to know about a potential property such as-

- When was it built?
- How big is the lot?
- Feet of living space is in the house?
- Basement is there or not?
- How many bathrooms are there?
- What is the neighborhood of the house?
