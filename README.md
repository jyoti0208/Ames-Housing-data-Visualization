# Ames-Housing-data-Visualization
<<<<<<< HEAD
When someone wants to buy their dream house they might be considering many aspects. This includes various features such as house cost, locality, size of the house and many more. Also, the importance of features might vary from person to person. We need to consider all possible features related to the house during this analysis. Most of the variables are exactly the type of information that a typical home buyer would want to know about a potential property such as-

- When was it built?
- How big is the lot?
- Feet of living space is in the house?
- Basement is there or not?
- How many bathrooms are there?
- What is the neighborhood of the house?
=======

1. First get raw data and draw initial plot

2. in slider js, add same filter function inside < if (this.minDomNode) {} if (this.maxDomNode) {} >, use original raw data , filter it, output will be filtered raw data

3. call updateGraph() after filtering in above section only


4. In updateGraph() , use the same drawing code, just use select(".class") instead of append() , also keep svg, margins, height, width as global so it is accessible in intialdraw and updateGraph functions
